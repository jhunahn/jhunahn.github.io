## WHO AM I ?
I am a software developer working in the System LSI division of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics Engineering at Dongguk University, Korea.

I have been working as a system software engineer in Medical System Lab for 4 years since 2012. In the meantime, I'd developed firmware of MRI system controllers and system monitor tool.
And then I moved to the IoT business team, where I'd been developing RTOS-based IoT device software for three years. I took part in [TizenRT](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/TizenRT/commits?author=jhunahn)[^tizenrt] development team. And I developed and distributed a python-based Unit-test framework for SW Integration of the ARTIK series.

Apart from working in my company, I experience a very interesting personally project in which, I learned a lot regarding my field of work.

I am a software developer working in the System LSI division of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics Engineering at Dongguk University, Korea.

I have been working as a system software engineer in Medical System Lab for 4 years since 2012. In the meantime, I'd developed firmware of MRI system controllers and system monitor tool.
And then I moved to the IoT business team, where I'd been developing RTOS-based IoT device software for three years. I took part in [TizenRT](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/TizenRT/commits?author=jhunahn)[^tizenrt] development team. And I developed and distributed a python-based Unit-test framework for SW Integration of the ARTIK series.

Apart from working in my company, I experience a very interesting personally project in which, I learned a lot regarding my field of work.

When I was a high school student, I studied Factory Automation System and Programmable Logic controller. And I won 2nd place in National Skills Olympics in Jeonju at 2004. This has been valuable experience for me to become a software engineer.

I went to university and studied deeper software engineering and electronics. The robot [**D-TriFL**](https://www.ti.com/ww/kr/pdfs/1_2011.pdf)[^dtrifl]   was a very memorable project. It was a robot that imitated [STriDER](http://www.romela.org/strider-self-excited-tripedal-dynamic-experimental-robot/)[^strider]   which is a robot that **Professor Dennis Hong** of [RoMeLa](http://www.romela.org) built. I was design the core mechanism, circuit, and the software profile that predicts the movement. It was an opportunity to make some progress in the mechanical and electronics.

More recently, I have been interested in machine learning projects.

Apart from all this, I love travelling, meeting new people and reading. The record of my trip can be found in my Instagram. Feel free to write to me with any questions or opportunities in technology that you think will interest me.
